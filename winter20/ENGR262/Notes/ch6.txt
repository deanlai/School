###Metals
##alloys and phase digrams
*metals* the most important engineering materials
-satisfy wide variety of design reqs
-processes developed and refined over many years
-easily predicted properties
Properties:
-high stiffness and strength
-good toughness
-
Processes:
-cast
wrought: shaped after cast
powdered: sintered
Types:
Ferrous: contains iron
nonferrous: does not contain iron
Pure metals: used for high conductivity applications
alloys: have enhanced mechanical properties
-increased strength, hardness
*Alloys*
mixture of two or more elements
solid solutions:
-substitutional (brass/bronze) vs. interstitial (steel)
intermediate phases form with diffient solubilities of alloy components
-could be metallic compounds:
-or intermetallic
85% of metal tonnage
mostly steel or cast iron
Steel: carbon between 0.1%-2.1%
Cast Iron: 2.1%-4/5% carbon
higher -> wrought iron
Ferrite: mostly iron
Cementite: high carbon phase
##steel making process
Iron:
-electrolytic iron: very pure
-ingot iron: 0.1% impure
-worught iton: higher impurities
iron making: ore -> pig iron
steel making: pig iron -> steel

##nonferrous metals


##superalloys
