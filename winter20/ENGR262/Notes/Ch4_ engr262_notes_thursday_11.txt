##Chapter 4: Physical properties of materials
##Part 1: Density/Thermal
ex. Important for machining as it effects mechanical properties of material and cutting tools --> Most machining operations benefit from cooling.

###Volumetric Properties
Density = weight/unit volume
typ. g/cm^3 (lb/in^3)
determined by atomic #, atomic radius, packing

strength to weight ratio: *tensile* strength/density
-useful for aerospace applications

Coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE)
-change in length/degree of temperature (mm/mm/C)
-length easier to measure than volume
L_2 - L_1 = alpha*L_1(T_2 - T_1)
-*important*: set T_2, L_2 to hotter or longer material.
-strong materials have smaller CTEs in general.
-used in shrink fit and expansion fit assemblies
-part is heated or cooled to fit with another part --> tight fit after cooling
-thermal expansion can be a problem in welding due to stresses
-in casting mold size must be larger than part size due to shrink

###Melting Properties
T_m temperature at which it transforms from solid to liquid state
-reverse transformation is called freezing point
**Heat of fusion** = heat energy required at T_m to transform from solid to liquid

Alloys have two melting temperatures called liquidus and solidus.
-liquidus: temp when first material metls
-solidus: temp when alloy solidifies

Glasses/amorphous materials have a glass-transition temp
GTT is a visco-elasti
c state in between solid and liquid state
-glasses/amorphous materials are molded when in visco-elastic state

metal casting - metals with lower melting points are generally easier to cast
plastic molding - melting characteristics of polys important for nearly all polymer processes
sintering of powdered metals - 

###Thermal Properties
specific heat: quant of energy req. to raise temp of unit mass by one degree
**H = CW(T_2 - T_1)**
H = heat, C = specific heat, W = weight, T_2 - T_1 = change in temp

thermal conductivity (k)
capability of a material to transfer heat *through itself*
-generally high for metals (free electrons), low in cermaics/polymers
-units for k: J/s mm C
-mechanism is phonon transfer

For manufacturing:
-heat trating, sintering metals/ceramics
-generated in cold forming/machining
-needed for casting, injection molding, vacuum thermoforming, hot forging, etc.

##Part 2: Electric/Electrochemical properties
###Mass Diffusion
Process of atoms of one material diffusing into another material
Diffusion highest at interface
substitutional vs. interstitial diffusion
used to dope silicon
Surface hardening based on diffusion -> carburizing and nitriding
-diffusion welding: used to join two components by pressing together and allowing diffusion accross bounary to create bond
-used in electronics to alter surface chemistry of semiconductor wafer in very localized regions to create circuits

###Electrical Properties
flow of current involves charge carriers
-electrical conductivity can change by 30 orders of magnitude in materials
-in solids charge carriers are e-
-in liquids charge carriers are pos/neg ions
Ohm's law: V = IR
*Resistance vs. Resistivity*
Resistance in a uniform section depends on L, A and reistivity r.
R = r(L/A) (Ohm*m)
conductivity = 1/r (1/Ohm*m)
resistivity changes with temperature:
-metals: resistivity increases with temperature
-semiconductors: resistivity decreases with temperature
in semicondutor industry: doped silicon tends to have constant resistivity over usage case temperature range.
-metals are best *conductors* due to metallic bonding
-ceramics/polymers are poor conductors due to covalent/ionic bonding
-ceramics/polys used as insulators due to high resistivity
semiconductors have resistivities between insulators and conductors
-silicon is most common due to abundance and ease of manufacture
-unique because their properties can be changed by doping
*Important for...*
EDM machining uses electrical energy to spark and remove materials
Arc welding uses electrical energy to melt materials

###Electrochecmical Properties
Electrochemisty: relationship between electricity and chemical changes and conversion of energies
electrolysis: anode -> pos bias, cathode -> neg bias
ex: decomposition of water
oppoosite of electrolysis is plating
electrochemical machining used to remove material from part surface
production of hydrogen and oxygen gases produced via electrolysis
