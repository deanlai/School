# Other Expendable Mold Casting (Not Sand)
*Shell mold casting*
-thin layer of adhered and cured sand formed around a master.
-two shell haves are assembled with metal shot used as support.
*vacuum molding*
-vacuum used instead of chemical binder to mechanically stabilize the mold
*expanded polystyrene*
-sand packed around polystyrene foam pattern that vaporizes
-useful for complicated molds
-pattern is wasted in every casting
-environmental concerns with vaporizing polystyrene
*investment casting or lost wax*
-wax pattern created
-plaster formed around pattern
-wax melted away
-metal cast into plaster

# Permanent Mold Casting
Econmically advantageous: save molds, casting is more rapid
Disadvantage: molds are very expensive
Typically uses metals with low melting points -> no steel
-aluminum, zinc, mangesium
Good dimensional control + surface finish
part geometry more limited due to clamshell mold
Die casting: High pressure molting material injected into mold

# Casting defects
