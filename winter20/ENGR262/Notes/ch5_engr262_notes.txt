##Chapter 5: Dimensions Tolerance and Surface

##Dimensions and Tolerance
Dimensions: linear or angular sizes of components
Tolerance: allowed variation
Dimension-> the size the deisgner wants
tolerance-> amount you can go outside of spec
-defines upper and lower limit
-higher tolerance increases cost of manufacturing
-Bilateral/Unilateral tolerance
-limit dimensions
*Measurment*: comparing unknown value to a standard
accuracy: degree to which measurment agrees with true value
precision: degree of repeatability of measurment
##Instruments and Gauges
Gage blocks: standards against which other measurements are compared
graduated measures: rules/calipers
not graduated: gage blocks, others.
Dial indicators: used to measure roundness or runoff
electronic gages: used transducers to convert linear displacement to electrical signal
In recent years microprocessor tech has made electrical gages replace many conventional gages
GO/NO-GO gages: checks if parts are in tolerance spec.
-uses a small and large dimension to check parts
Angles: protractors

##Surfaces
Nominal surface: surface designer intended defined by engineering drawing
Actual surface: determined by manufacturing processes
Variety of processes produce variation in surface
-Aesthetic
-safety
-friction/wear
-mechanical/physical properties
-assembly
-smooth surfaces make better electric contacts
*Surface Technology*
Texture: topography + geometric features
-waviness and scratches
roughness: fine variations determined by processed that formed surface
waviness: vibration/delfection, etc.
Lay: how to orient surface texture
surface roughness: measurable variations
surface finish: qualitative characteristics
R_a, average roughness is the intergral of surface height over a length
*measurement of surfaces-->
subjective: fingernail test
stylus electronic instruments
optical instruments
*tolerances in manufacturing processess*
-most machining accurate to +_0.05mm or better
-sand casting generally inaccurate with tolerance 10x to 20x greater than machined parts
