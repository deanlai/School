INTRODUCTION
For our upcoming group technical report we will be choosing a topic to persue that best fits with our interests. What follows is my proposal for our group topic, an investigative report on a sub-project of NASA and the USGS called LandSat. This proposal will cover the broad mission of the LandSat satellites along with some specific missions and research and introduce some of the paths we can take toward completing the report. I hope to find a space of shared interest among us that keeps us all engaged in the process of writing and presenting out report and I have chosen a topic with a lot of space to explore and within which we can all find a niche.

PRESENTATION OF OPTION
NASA and the USGS are large government agencies with many divisions and projects that involve all major scientific and engineering disciplines. For our technical report I propose that we profile and analyze NASA and USGS earth science division, with specific focus on the LandSat satellites. LandSat is an ongoing series of Earth observation missions that NASA lauches in partnership with the USGS. As an alternative topic, the earth science division has other large scale projects that may be of more interest to us than LandSat. LandSat was chosen due to a shared interest in aerospace from the mechnical engineers in our group, and a shared interest in climate science research from the environmental scientists in our group. 

DESCRIPTION OF FOCUS
LandSat is a series of Earth observation satellites, with two currently operational vehicles, LandSat 7 and LandSat 8. LandSat 9 is in development and scheduled to launch in December of 2020. There are two primary paths we could take with the LandSat focus: A broad and historical view of the entire series of LandSat missions starting with LandSat 1 in 1972 or a more focused investigation of the most current operational vehicle, LandSat 8. LandSat cameras capture images of earth in various bands of the electromagnetic spectrum, both within and outside the visible range. This imaging data is processed the USGS and NASA to gain insights into many phenomena on Earth including tracking deforestation, cloud coverage, localized fires, watersheds and irrigation, and polar ice levels. LandSat 8 in particular has a nine-band optical imager and two-band thermal imager. The LandSat series of satellites are an instrumental part of global climate change research due to the longevity of the program and the data we continue to gather from the current vehicles.

JUSTIFICATION OF FOCUS
Using LandSat as a topic for a group technical report would allow all group members to persue a sub-topic they are passionate about while having a cohesive theme to tie to report together. From the engineering side, LandSat involves a host of mission planning hurdles from physical design of the satellite itself to sucessfully launching the vehicle and keeping it running in orbit for years or decades. From the environmental science side, LandSat is a vital part of the Earth science research peformed by NASA and USGS and has captured decades of imaging data of all sorts of environmental developments, from the Mt. St. Helens eruption, to degradation of the Greenland ice sheet. Many of the most well known high-resolution images of environmental events were taken by LandSat satellites: the gulf oil spill, the flooding of New Orleans during hurricane Katrina, and the recent rapid spread of the Australian bush fires.

LIMITATIONS OF FOCUS
While LandSat as a topic does give of access to a wealth of data of publications from both NASA and the USGS, the mission ultimately a high tech and autonomous camera. There is a human element to the data processing and research, but this is not a manned spaceflight mission and is similarly not manned forestry or geological research. For those interested in the socio-economic and political impacts of climate change, LandSat is a powerful tool for generating data, but is ultimately far removed from policy. If one is interested in the science and research around carbon sequestering and logistics of forestation, LandSat can provide context and data for the effectiveness of these measures, but it does not otherwise contribute to them.
